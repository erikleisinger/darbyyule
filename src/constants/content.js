      Since it is a Low-Barrier service, we needed to address all of the barriers that arose from the website. Was it Mobile Forward? Was there a way for the clients to make contact easily? What do they do when they are on a waitlist? Is it accessible?`},

      As compared to many other mediums within the UI/UX spectrum, Content Design is a very introspective process. This project was to find my niche.
      
      I started with a simple brainstorm and Venn Diagram consisting of three questions: ‘What am I good at?’, ‘What do people need? ‘, and ‘What do I like to do?’. As a result, I realized that I have a very specific background in music creation, mental health, and design. I grew up playing in Punk bands and toured for years which gives me a very specific voice.`,

The blog is all about the feeling one gets sitting in a soundcheck waiting for a show. I felt that this is important for this specific audience as many of them are ex-Punk kids and spent much of their time at shows in their youth. `,

The users I identified in the research stage are very into lyrics and acoustic music so it was a natural place to start. 

      This piece introduces the audience to my niche and gives them a chance to dive deeper  and explore my brand. It also opens up opportunities to interact with the audience and drive sales/longterm users to my projects in the future. `,
